1. I want to know the list of our customers and their spending

select c.customer_id, sum(m.Price) from public.car_order as c
	 inner join public.car_master as m on c.car_id = m.car_id
   --where clause to specify time period
	 group by c.customer_id ;




2.	I want to find out the top 3 car manufacturers that customers bought by sales (quantity) and the sales number for it in the current month.

select manufacturer, c.cnt as "Cars Sold" from car_master m
(select c.car_id,  count(c.car_id) as cnt  from public.car_order as c
	where c.sales_date between <startDate> and <End Date>
	 group by c.car_id 
   order by cnt desc) c
   where m.car_id = c.car_id
   fetch first 3 rows only;
   
  Note: This above query is for oracle database, similaryly we can use top for SQL server, Limit for MySQL, 


-- the following is the query you can run on free online oracle database(https://livesql.oracle.com) to get top 3 products
select p.product_name, p.product_id, c.cnt
from CO.PRODUCTS P, (
select product_id, count(product_id) as cnt from CO.ORDER_ITEMS
group by product_id
order by cnt desc) c
where c.product_id = P.product_id
fetch first 3 rows only;
